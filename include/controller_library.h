//
// Loading of a shared object (dynamic library)
//
// A shared object (.so) library gets loaded when needed
// at runtime. This kind of loading happens AUTOMATICALLY.
// The necessary machine language instructions got added to the
// binary executable by the compiler and linker during translation.
//

//
// Keyword "extern"
//
// A function is declared with storage class "extern"
// by DEFAULT, even if the keyword "extern" is missing.
// The keyword "extern" has NO influence on the source code in
// terms of optimisation or the like and thus is NOT necessary.
// It is just a HINT to the reader (developer) indicating that
// the function is implemented in an EXTERNAL source file.
// A COMMENT like this one can be used as hint, instead of that keyword.
//

//
// The functions are ordered following the system LIFECYCLE.
