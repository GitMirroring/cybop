//
// CAUTION! This comment is valid for all "select" functions below.
//
// The comparison result HAS TO BE ZERO (r == 0),
// if a detection is to be taking place!
//
// Many "detect" functions are called in a sequence, below.
// If the result of one detection function was positive (r == 1), then that
// function increments the current position and decrements the remaining count.
// In this case, further detection functions following afterwards might detect
// further characters and CHANGE the current position and remaining count,
// and so forth, which would have the effect of "JUMPING" over some characters
// and produce WRONG RESULTS!
//
// Therefore, the checks for (r == 0) below avoid another detection,
// if the result already has a value unequal zero.
//
// CAUTION! If a detection was successful, then the current position and remaining count
// were already adapted within the corresponding "detect" function (as called below),
// so that they now point to the first character following the detected character sequence.
// Any "decode" function called afterwards can rely on this and start processing right away.
