//
// Reflexions on character set conversion.
//
// A URI is composed from a limited set of characters consisting of
// digits, letters, and a few graphic symbols. A reserved subset of
// those characters may be used to delimit syntax components within a
// URI while the remaining characters, including both the unreserved set
// and those reserved characters not acting as delimiters, define each
// component's identifying data.
//
// A percent-encoding mechanism is used to represent a data octet in a
// component when that octet's corresponding character is outside the
// allowed set or is being used as a delimiter of, or within, the component.
// A percent-encoded octet is encoded as a character triplet,
// consisting of the percent character "%" followed by the two
// hexadecimal digits representing that octet's numeric value.
//
// Example:
//
// percent-encoding: %20
// binary octet: 00100000
// ABNF: %x20
// US-ASCII: space character (SP)
//
// The uppercase hexadecimal digits 'A' through 'F' are equivalent to
// the lowercase digits 'a' through 'f', respectively. If two URIs
// differ only in the case of hexadecimal digits used in percent-encoded
// octets, they are equivalent. For consistency, URI producers and
// normalisers should use uppercase hexadecimal digits for all
// percent-encodings.
//
// Reserved characters:
// - generic delimiters: : / ? # [ ] @
// - sub delimiters: ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =
//
// URI producing applications should percent-encode data octets that
// correspond to characters in the reserved set unless these characters
// are specifically allowed by the URI scheme to represent data in that
// component. If a reserved character is found in a URI component and
// no delimiting role is known for that character, then it must be
// interpreted as representing the data octet corresponding to that
// character's encoding in US-ASCII.
//
// Characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a reserved
// purpose are called unreserved. These include uppercase and lowercase
// letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.
//
// Unreserved characters: ALPHA DIGIT - . _ ~
//
// URIs that differ in the replacement of an unreserved character
// with its corresponding percent-encoded US-ASCII octet are
// equivalent: they identify the same resource. However, URI
// comparison implementations do not always perform normalisation
// prior to comparison. For consistency, percent-encoded octets
// in the ranges of:
// - ALPHA (%41-%5A and %61-%7A)
// - DIGIT (%30-%39)
// - hyphen (%2D)
// - period (%2E)
// - underscore (%5F)
// - tilde (%7E)
// should NOT BE created by URI producers and, when found in a URI,
// SHOULD BE decoded to their corresponding unreserved characters.
//
// http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
// (Chapter 2 "Characters")
//

//
// RFC 3986 does not determine which character set to use for decoding
// non-ASCII characters (e.g. Umlauts like ä, ö, ü). Since a two-digit
// hexadecimal number (which corresponds to 2x eight Bit) is used for url
// encoding, it would be theoretically possible to use an 8 Bit character
// set (e.g. ISO-8859-1 for Umlauts).
//
// However, since many languages have their own 8 Bit character sets, it
// would be rather tedious to handle all these different character sets.
// Moreover, some languages (e.g. Chinese) may not be represented using an
// 8 Bit character set. For this reason, RFC 3629 suggests to represent
// non-ASCII characters using the UTF-8 character set.
//

//
// CAUTION! Percent-encoding may be used for all URI, including URL and URN.
//

//
// Example:
//
// http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem%C3%BCse
//
// The German word for vegetable: Gemüse
// The Umlaut letter ü gets percent-escaped as: %C3%BC
//
